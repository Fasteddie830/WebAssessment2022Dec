{"id":"2","name":"Soft-boiled eggs","description":"Fresh eggs","category":"snack","ingredients":"2 large free-range eggs at room temperature, toast to serve","recipe":"   \n STEP 1   \n Fill a medium sized saucepan with water and bring to a rolling boil.   \n STEP 2   \n Make sure your eggs aren't fridge cold. By having the eggs at room temperature, it will be less of a shock for the egg reaching the hot water and therefore less likely to crack. You can also use an egg pricker to make a very small hole in each egg before boiling, which will also reduce the chances of it cracking in the heat. Slowly lower the eggs into the water using a spoon.   \n STEP 3   \n Set your timer for 4-5 mins for runny/dippy eggs to serve withsoldiers, or 6-7 mins for soft-boiled eggs for a salad. If serving in a salad, plunge the eggs into a bowl of cold water as soon as the timer goes off, this will stopthem cooking and cool the shells quickly for peeling.","serving":"1","original":"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/soft-boiled-eggs","image":"https://www.culinaryhill.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/How-to-Soft-Boil-Eggs-Culinary-Hill-1200x800-1.jpg","ratings":[4,4,5,2,1,5,4,3,5,3],"_id":"tg4dW4nBrWBNEVz6"}
